The State of the Game
3 August 2022

Flatliners (working title as usual) is entering its group project phase at long last...

It's hard to believe this game started as a simple text file and a set of dice way back in the summer of 2018. What once fit comfortably in a small editor window now spans ~38 pages for the manual alone. We've also got a lorebook, various documents dedicated to spinoff narratives, and a ridiculous amount of character notes. I thought for sure when I started that I wouldn't spend more than a year on this. Especially considering that the game was itself a spinoff of a novel, which grew from a stupid little fan-fiction idea. I'll never get used to the way my brain leads me down rabbit holes.

Our team currently consists of myself and two core members. We've received offers of collaboration, both casual and serious from an increasing number of peers - most of whom I have no direct acquaintance with. And our player base, while small, is extremely passionate and dedicated. I couldn't be more thankful. There's so much I want to do in life. I know the grass is greener where you water it, but I never thought this idea would take root the way it has. But all the time I've put into filling in gaps and makinng the world internally consistent is starting to pay off. I can't wait to see where we go next.
